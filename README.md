## Introduction

**Minishell** is a project developed by [tviejo](https://github.com/tviejo) and [ade-sarr](https://github.com/ade-sarr) as part of the curriculum at School 42. The goal of this project is to create a miniature version of the Unix shell, replicating essential functionalities of **bash** with a focus on POSIX compliance. Minishell allows users to execute commands, handle input/output redirections, manage environment variables, and more, providing a foundational understanding of shell operations.

## Features

### Basic Functions

- **Redirections**
  - Output Redirection: `>`
  - Append Redirection: `>>`
  - Heredoc: `<<`
- **Pipes**
  - Chain commands using `|`
- **Quotes Handling**
  - Double Quotes: `" "`
  - Single Quotes: `' '`
- **Error Handling**
  - Return values using `$?`
- **Environment Variables**
  - Access and modify environment variables
- **Signal Handling**
  - `Ctrl+D` to exit
  - `Ctrl+C` to interrupt
  - `Ctrl+\` to quit

### Builtins

- **echo**
  - Usage: `echo [-n] [string ...]`
  - Supports the `-n` option to omit the trailing newline
- **cd**
  - Usage: `cd [directory]`
  - Supports only relative or absolute paths
- **pwd**
  - Usage: `pwd`
  - Prints the current working directory
- **export**
  - Usage: `export [variable]`
  - Adds or modifies environment variables
- **unset**
  - Usage: `unset [variable]`
  - Removes environment variables
- **env**
  - Usage: `env`
  - Displays all environment variables
- **exit**
  - Usage: `exit`
  - Exits the shell

### Bonus Features

- **Logical Operators**
  - AND: `&&`
  - OR: `||`
- **Subshells**
  - Usage: `()`
  - Execute commands in a subshell
- **Wildcards**
  - Support for wildcard characters like `*` and `?`

## Installation

To install and set up Minishell on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tviejo/minishell.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd minishell
   ```

3. **Compile the Project**

   Ensure you have `make` and a compatible C compiler installed.

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will generate the `minishell` executable.

## Usage

Run Minishell by executing the compiled binary:

```bash
./minishell
```

Once inside the shell, you can start typing commands as you would in a standard bash shell.

### Exiting Minishell

- Press `Ctrl+D` or type `exit` to exit the shell.

## Examples

### Executing a Simple Command

```bash
minishell$ ls -la
```

### Using Builtins

```bash
minishell$ echo -n "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!minishell$
```

### Changing Directory

```bash
minishell$ cd /usr/local
minishell$ pwd
/usr/local
```

### Redirections and Pipes

```bash
minishell$ cat file.txt | grep "search_term" > output.txt
```

### Handling Signals

- Pressing `Ctrl+C` will interrupt the current command.
- Pressing `Ctrl+\` will quit the shell.
